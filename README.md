# KiCad SS-50 Library from Corsham Technologies, LLC

This is a free to use library that was developed during our creation of
various SS-30/SS-50 boards.  There is no implied warranty at all, no
implied support, and the user is solely responsible for determining if
these libraries work or not for their intended application.  It may be
used for commercial and non-commercial purposes.  Credit would be 
appreciated.

The initial version of the library was poorly laid out as I was not
used to KiCad, but hopefully now it is structured better and is easy
to pull into your environment.  Please let me know if there are still
packaging problems.

This contains symbols and footprints for the basic MOLEX 1-640384-0 and
09-48-2101 connectors used for the SS-50/SS-30 busses.  There are also
parts for the SS-30, SS-50 and SS-50C busses.

Many fixes were applied in early 2021.
